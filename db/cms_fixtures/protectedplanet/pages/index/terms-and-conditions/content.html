  ProtectedPlanet.net is the new face of the World Database on Protected
  Areas (WDPA). Its humble beginnings started 30 years ago as the United
  Nations global list of national parks and has evolved into the only global,
  spatially referenced information source on parks and protected areas. We
  have created ProtectedPlanet.net not only to showcase this wealth of
  information, but also give tools to willing ‘citizen scientists’ who can
  feed their knowledge about protected areas into the WDPA.
