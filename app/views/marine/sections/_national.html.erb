<h2 class="header--h2-insights">MPA’s within national jurisdiction</h2>

<p class="t--marine__section__introduction">
  Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) can be created for a variety of purposes in different areas within the global ocean. There is a higher percentage of MPAs established within national waters than in ABNJ (relative to the size of area). In addition, a number of nations have extensive national waters around their overseas territories (a territory or country that is a part of or dependent upon another state but is geographically distinct from that state). There is an increasing trend in the creation of large MPAs in overseas territories. For example, overseas territories make up 89.3% of Great Britain’s national waters, and of this area, 49.78% has been designated as protected areas, equating to 3,008,171.24 km². Comparatively, only 28.44% of Britain’s national waters (excluding overseas territories) have been designated.
