<h2 class="header--h2-insights">Effectively of marine protected areas</h2>

    An increasing need exists for the evaluation and understanding of the effectiveness of marine protected areas operating around the world. Protected Area Management Effectiveness (PAME), in particular the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) is used in many parts of the world. Using such tools, a recent study (Gill et al. 2017) suggests that while ecological factors are key to enhancing the performance of MPAs, available capacity including resources and staff are fundamental for effective protected area management.

    The World Conservation Union (IUCNs) World Commission on Protected Areas initiated the IUCN Green List of Protected and Conserved Areas Standard to increase the number of protected and conserved areas that are effectively and equitable managed and deliver conservation outcomes. See a list of marine protected areas below that potentially meet the Green List Standard.
